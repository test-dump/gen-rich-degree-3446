This could include general knowledge or helpful purpose-specific instructions, depending on the context. For instance, if someone is learning how to cook, \"useful to know\" information might include tips for keeping food from sticking to the pan. In a broader context, \"useful to know\" might be something like practical life advice or important facts about a certain subject."},{"role":"user","content":"Unit tests:\n\nYou asked for instructions on how to make a hello world console app in C#. Here it is:\n\n1. First of all, you need to create a new project in Visual Studio. To do this, click on `File` -\u003e `New` -\u003e `Project`. Select the \"Console App (.NET Core)\" template.\n\n2. Once you have your new project, you will see a `Program.cs` file generated automatically. This is your main program file.\n\n3. You will need to replace the auto-generated code in `Program.cs` file with the following code:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nnamespace HelloWorld\n{\n    class Program\n    {\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Hello World!\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n4. Now you can run your program by pressing `Ctrl + F5`. The console app will be opened and you should see \"Hello World!\" displayed.\n\nThis simple `Hello World` console application is a good starting point to get acquainted with C# programming. It helps to understand the basic structure of C# program and know how to output to console. It is the most simple and basic program that every programmer starts with while learning a new programming language.\n\nNote: Microsoft Visual Studio is the most popular IDE for C# programming, but Visual Studio Code could also be used, your choice will depend on your requirements and preferences."},{"role":"assistant","content":"If you are expecting to create unit tests for your `Hello World` console application in C#, you can follow the steps given below:\n\n1. Create a new project in Visual Studio. To do this, click `File` -\u003e `New` -\u003e `Project`. From the new project dialog box, select `xUnit Test Project (.NET Core)`.\n\n2. Your test project should come with a class called `UnitTest1.cs` which is a placeholder for your tests.\n\n3. Rename your `UnitTest1.cs` to `ProgramTests.cs` (Right-click on the filename in the Solution Explorer, select `rename`, and type the new name).\n\n4. Open `ProgramTests.cs` and replace the template code with the following code:\n\n```csharp\nusing HelloWorld;  // The namespace of your hello world application\nusing Xunit;\n\nnamespace HelloWorldTests\n{\n    public class ProgramTests\n    {\n        [Fact]\n        public void Test1()\n        {\n            var output = Program.GetHelloWorld();\n            Assert.Equal(\"Hello World!\", output);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n5. You will realize that this test will fail because `Program.GetHelloWorld()` does not exist. To make the test pass, let's go back to your `Program.cs` and modify it like so:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nnamespace HelloWorld\n{\n    class Program\n    {\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(GetHelloWorld());\n        }\n\n        public static string GetHelloWorld()\n        {\n            return \"Hello World!\";\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou could find and run your tests via `Test` -\u003e `Run All Tests`.\n\nThis is a very basic example of unit testing in C#. In a larger, more complex project, you may have many different classes and methods that will need their own separate tests. The `Xunit` framework also supports a variety of other features, including the ability to create tests that require setup or teardown code, and the ability to create parameterized tests."}]
